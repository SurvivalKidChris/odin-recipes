    <p>Use this recipe for perfectly cooked hard-boiled eggs. By adding a little vinegar <br>
    and salt, the eggshell peels off so easily without tearing or sticking. I have been making them this way for years!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>8 Eggs</li>
     <li>1 Tablespoon ofSalt</li>
     <li>1 Tablespoon of Pepper</li>
     <li>6 Cups of water</li>
     <li>Â¼ cup distilled white vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients Combine salt, vinegar, and water in a large pot, and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
    <li>Add eggs one at a time, being careful not to crack them. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil, and cook for 14 minutes.</li>
    <li>Once eggs have cooked, remove them from the hot water, and place into a container of ice water or cold, running water. Cool completely, about 15 minutes. Store in the refrigerator up to 1 week.</li>
